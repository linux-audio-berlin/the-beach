*Current, official "The Beach" BWS version: 2.3.5 (2018-07-11)*

The Beach
=========

Sounds you probably heard on your last trip to the beach.

A customizable, open source beach synthesis model.
Made with <3 and Bitwig Studio.

How??
=====

Built only using stock Bitwig Studio components, this project aims to recreate
customizable sound collages simulating the ambient noise on a beach.

So far, this includes:

 * Wave noise
 * Wind and wind resonance noise
 * Seagull cries!
 * Halyard noise from a nearby harbour
 * Circada noise from a nearby forrest

Why?
====

1. For the fun
2. Because we can
3. Accoustic relaxation therapy
4. Learning and experimenting around the synthesis of natural sounds
5. A crowd sourced project is a lot more fun

Also, we probably all just need a vacation, ok?
It is usually in wintertime, that i work on this ;)
